## LVGL drivers and peripheral interface for Chinese Sunton Smart display boards ESP32-2432S028R, ESP32-3248S035R and ESP32-3248S035C.

This library supports these boards without any effort.

## Why this library

With the boards, there is a link supplied and there are a lot of examples present and this looks fine.
These examples for [LVGL](https://lvgl.io/) depend on external libraries ([TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI) or [LovyanGFX](https://github.com/lovyan03/LovyanGFX)).
However, when implementing the capacitive version, I found out that these libraries had their flaws using these boards.
Additionally, There was a log of unnecessary code included in these libraries.
There is also a library for [LVGL](https://lvgl.io/) present [LVGL_ESP32_drivers](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl_esp32_drivers) but this is not aimed at the Arduino framework but ESP-IDF framework.

## Where and why buying these boards

These boards are available on AliExpress for decent prices and offer a lot.
They can be bought in the [Sunton Store](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/1100192306) on AliExpress but saw them also from other sellers.

## How to use

Basically there are **two** defines that need to be present:

- Type of board
    - ESP32_2432S028R
    - ESP32_3248S035R
    - ESP32_3248S035C
- Orientation of the board
    - TFT_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT
    - TFT_ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE
    - TFT_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT_INV
    - TFT_ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE_INV

These can be defined in the ```platformio.ini``` file by (un)define the settings:

```ini
build_flags =
    ...
    ...
    # LVGL settings
    -D LV_LVGL_H_INCLUDE_SIMPLE
    # For lv_conf.h
    -I ./include
    # Smartdisplay settings
    -D TFT_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT
    #-D TFT_ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE
    #-D TFT_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT_INV
    #-D TFT_ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE_INV
    -D ESP32_2432S028R
    #-D ESP32_3248S035R
    #-D ESP32_3248S035C
```
